<p>Neural networks are the driving force behind many of the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) today. These complex systems, inspired by the human brain, have the ability to learn from data and make predictions.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-neural-network">What is a Neural Network?</h3>
<p>At its core, a neural network is a series of algorithms that attempt to recognize patterns in data. It consists of layers of nodes, or “neurons,” each of which processes input data and passes it to the next layer.</p>

<h3 id="how-neural-networks-work">How Neural Networks Work</h3>
<p>Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation, where the network adjusts its weights based on the error of its predictions. This iterative process allows the network to improve its accuracy over time.</p>

<h3 id="applications-of-neural-networks">Applications of Neural Networks</h3>
<p>Neural networks have a wide range of applications, from image recognition to natural language processing. They are used in everything from virtual assistants to autonomous vehicles, making them one of the most versatile tools in AI.</p>

<h3 id="the-future-of-neural-networks">The Future of Neural Networks</h3>
<p>As research in neural networks continues to advance, we can expect to see even more innovative applications. The potential for neural networks to revolutionize industries is enormous, and we are only beginning to scratch the surface of what they can achieve.</p>
