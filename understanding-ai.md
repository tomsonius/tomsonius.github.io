# Understanding AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. AI encompasses a wide range of technologies and applications, from simple automation to advanced machine learning algorithms.

## What is AI?

AI involves the creation of algorithms and systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and understanding natural language.

## How AI Works

AI systems work by processing large amounts of data, learning patterns and correlations, and making predictions or decisions based on this information. Machine learning, a subset of AI, involves training models on data to improve their accuracy over time.

## What are LLMs?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of AI model designed to understand and generate human-like text. These models are trained on vast datasets and can perform a wide range of language-based tasks, from translation to creative writing.
